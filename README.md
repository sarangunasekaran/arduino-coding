Remote Water Distribution System


Abstract:
A system-like module that ensures the availability of water in the home and supplies water through the pipe by the handheld easy-access mobile application, based on consumer’s requirement. A mishmash of hardware and software technology brings better experience with customary options and was developed by concerning the golden words – not to wastewater. This will help save water by fetching only the requirement of water. This paper put forth the complete instruction that is needed to be followed is explained. 
Summary 
A smart combination of water distribution and management systems that can be able to access from anywhere. It establishes the connection between the consumer and supplier through the artificial enhancement of mobile applications. This system ensures the availability of water and feeds on the basis of the consumer’s needs. This article is about the Remote Water Distribution System developed by three students under the guidance of EIE faculties. 
People don’t know the value of water unless the restrictions are applied in the real world. A large amount of water, if wasted in one house that causes a lack of water to some people. According to recent research, it says that water would completely exterminate around the globe in a few years if the industrial wastes mixes and people do not follow the “save water” guideline. And so, this project is evolved in order to save water, with an optimal cost that everyone could able to spend.
The system proposed here was in the form of a prototype and further, the development can be done with some minor changes, owing to the need.
The system consists of a microcontroller to control the whole structure, a flow sensor to detect the level of water l, ow, and a relay to activate the sensors. 
S.NO.	COMPONENTS	CHARGE (in INR)
1.	Arduino Mega	1,540
2.	Water Flow Sensor	300
3.	Relay	450
4.	Motor	2,000 

This system ensures the level of water in the tanks and sends a notification if the water level reaches down the threshold value. The threshold level can be fixed by the consumer through mobile applications. The consumer can obtain water 250 liters a day, and the limit can be predetermined by the water provider. Punter reaches less can request for water through their mobile application and the provider will be notified. Based on the request and approval, consumers can fetch water. This system also combines the recycling of water schemes to utilize used water again. 

 
This is the opening screen of the system application developed by us.
 
Users can monitor the water level and it might take some seconds.
 
It approximately takes 30-50 seconds to reach the server and to show results.
 
Once reached, the results are shown in various formats.
 
Consumers, if run out of the water, can request for refill facility on this screen.
